# - This is a placeholder. The actual implementation will depend heavily on the
#   final structure of the Athena query results.
# - The goal is to transform the raw, row-based Athena output into a set of
#   feature vectors that the EWMA model can process.
# - This might involve one-hot encoding, grouping, and creating unique keys
#   for each entity to be tracked (e.g., a key combining ip, ua, and uri).
